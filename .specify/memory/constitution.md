# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

1. **Specification-Driven Development** - All features begin with a clear specification before implementation.
2. **Type Safety** - TypeScript strict mode is mandatory across all projects.
3. **Test Coverage** - New features must include tests.
4. **Small, Focused Changes** - PRs should be small and address a single concern.
5. **Security First** - Never hardcode secrets; validate at system boundaries.
